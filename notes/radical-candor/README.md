# Preface

## Motivation

# Part I - A New Management Philosophy
It's brutally hard to tell people when they are screwing up (...) Management is hard.
"At Apple we hire people to tell us what to do, not the other way around."

## 1. Build Radically Candid Relationships (Bringing your self to work)
- A radically candid relationship starts with the basic respect and common decency that every human being owes each other, regardless of worldview.


### It's called management, and it's your job

- Emotional labor is the key to being a good boss.

### How to be a good boss

- Bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their teams.
- Bosses guide a team to achieve results.
- **Guidance**, **team**, **results**: these are the responsibilities of any boss.
  - Guidance: feedback
  - Team-building: hiring,firing,promoting
  - Results: Get things done

### Relationships, not power, drive you forward

![img.png](img.png)

### Radical Candor

- Care personally
  - Being more than "just professional", about giving a damn, sharing more than just your work self, encouraging everyone who reports to you to do the same.
  - Not just business; it is personal, and deeply personal. 
  - Not enough to care only about people's ability to perform a job.

- Challenge Directly
  - Telling people when their work isn't good enough.
  - Delivering hard feedback, making hard calls about who does what on a team, and holding a high bar for results.
  - Challenging people is often the best way to show them that you care when you're the boss even if it does not seem like a good way to build a relationship or to show that you "care personally"

- ![img_7.png](img_7.png)

### Care Personally:The First Dimension of Radical Candor

- People evolve, and so your relationships must evolve with them. Care personally; don't put people in boxes and leave them there.

### Challenge Directly: The Second Dimension of Radical Candor

- The source of everything respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being [is] that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying his mistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experiencing alone. There must be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted.
**("Degisim hatayi kabul etmekle baslar")**

- Challenging others and encouraging them to challenge you helps build **trusting relationships**.
  - You are willing to admit when you're wrong 
  - You are committed to fixing mistakes that you or others have made.
  - You care enough to point out both the things that aren't going well.
  - Because challenging often involves disagreeing or saying no, this approach embraces conflict rather than avoiding it. 
  - Difficult at the outset
  - Hardest part of building trust is inviting people to challenge you, just as directly as you are challenging them.
  - You may be the one who feels upset or angry. This takes some getting used to.
  - Takes a real energy on both side.
  - Do it for things that really matter. A good rule of thumb for any relationship is to leave three unimportant things unsaid each day.
  - Practiing "up", "down", "sideways". not hierarchical thing.

### What Radical Candor is Not

- not a license to gratuitously harsh
- not front-stab
- not an innovation to nitpick (kusur bulma)
- not a hierarchical thing
- not about schmoozing (kaynasma)
- not about endless extroversion that exhausts the introverts on your team.
- not about getting drunk or driving go-carts or playing laser tag or having endless dinners with colleagues. Of course, those are good things.

### Radical Candor is Universally Human, but interpersonally and culturally relative

- Radically Candor was too aggressive for Japanese, "politely persistent" worked well in Tokyo.
- Brits, despite all their politeness, tend to be even more candid than New Yorkers.

## 2. Get, Dive, and Encourage Guidance (Create a culture of open communication)

![img_13.png](img_13.png)

### "Um" Story

- Do not personalize.

### "Operationalizing" Good Guidance

- Being clear about what happens when you fail to care personally or challenge directly will help you avoid backsliding into old habits.
- The names of each quadrant refer to **guidance**, not to **personality treats**.
- They are a way to gauge **praise** and **criticism**.
- Not to be used to label people. Labeling hinders improvement.

### Radical Candor

#### Radically Candid praise "I admire that about you"

- It should be contextualized, far more personal, and specific.

#### Radically Candid criticism "To keep winning, criticize the wins"

- Challenging is important to success.
- The secret to winning is to point out to great players what they could have done better, even when they have just won a game. Especially when they have just won a game.

### Obnoxious Aggression
- Brutal honesty or front stabbing
- When you criticize someone without taking even two seconds to show you care, your guidance feels obnoxiously aggressive to the recipient.
- what happens when you challenge someone directly, but don't show you care about them personally. It's praise that does not feel sincere or criticism that is not delivered kindly.
- It's also the second-best thing you can do if you can't be Radically Candid. People rather work for a "competent asshole" than a "nice competent."
- Keep your humanity intact
- Belittling employees, embarrass them publicly, freeze them out.
- Gets result in short-term but leaves a trail of dead bodies in its wake in the long run.
- In the toxic culture of guidance, criticism is a weapon rather than a tool for improvement; it makes the giver feel powerful and the receiver feel awful. Even praise can feel more like a backhanded compliment than a celebration. "You got it right **this** time"

#### Obnoxiously aggressive criticism (Front-stabbing)


#### Obnoxiously aggressive praise (Belittling compliments)

### Manipulative Insincerity
Backstabbing, political or passive-aggressive behavior - it's praise that is insincere, flattery to a person's face and harsh criticism behind their back.


#### Manipulatively insincere praise
- When you do not care enough about a person to challenge directly.
- People give praise and criticism that is manipulatively insincere when they are too focused on being liked or think they can gain some sort of political advantage by being **fake** - or when they are just too tired to care or argue or anymore.
- Guidance that is manipulatively insincere **rarely** reflects what the speaker actually thinks; rather; it is an attempt to push the other person's emotional buttons in return for some personal gain.
- "He'll be happy if I tell him I liked his stupid presentation, and that will make my life easier than explaining why it sucked. In the long run, though, I really need to find someone to replace him."
- Leadership is sometimes about being willing to piss people off. 
- When you are overly worried about how people will perceive you, you're willing to say what needs to be said. 
- You may feel it's because you care about the team, but really, in those all-too-human moments you may care too much how they feel about you - in other words, about yourself.
- Give a damn about the people you challenge. 

- Unfortunately, conventional wisdom and a lot of management advice pushes bosses to challenge less, rather than encouraging them to care more. Generally resulting praise and criticism feels to employees like flattery and backstabbing. This does not build trust.

### Ruinous Empathy

- When bosses are too invested in everyone getting along, they also fail to encourage the people on their team to criticize one another for fear of sowing discord.
- They create the kind of work environment where "being nice" is prioritized at the expense critiquing, and therefore improving actual performance.

- What happens when you want to spare someone's short-term feelings, so you don't tell them something they need to know.

#### Ruinously empathetic praise "Just trying to say something nice"

- Trying to make happy
- When giving praise, investigate until you really understand who did what and why it was so great. Be as specific and through with praise as with criticism. Go deep into the details.

### Moving Toward Radical Candor

#### Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it (Do not dish it out before you show you can take it)

- Best way to show that you are aware that you are often wrong, and that you want to hear about it when you are; you want to be challenged.
- Second you will learn a lot.
- Third, teaches how it feels to receive criticism.
- Fourth, great way to build trust and strengthen your relationships.

- Not just being open to criticism but by actively soliciting it.
- If a person is bold enough to criticize you, do not critique their criticism. 
- If you see somebody criticizing a peer inappropriately, say something.
- If somebody criticizes **you** inappropriately, your job is to listen with the intent to understand and then to reward the candor.

- The  key to soliciting criticism is **not to react defensively**.
- The  key to soliciting criticism is **enduring silence**.

#### Balance praise and criticism (Worry more about praise, less about criticism - but above all be sincere)

- We learn more from our mistakes than our successes, more from criticism than from praise.
- Giving more praise than criticism guides people in the right direction. It's just as important to let people know what to do more of as what to do less of.
- Second, it encourages people to keep improving. In other words, the best praise does a lot more than just make people feel good. It can actually challenge them directly.
- Criticism-praise ratio mindset may seem unnatural, insincere, or just plain ridiculous.
- When giving praise, put more energy into how praise can go wrong.
- "If I'm not firing you, it means you're doing fine". That's not good enough.

#### Understand the perilous border between Obnoxious Aggression and Radical Candor (Your work is shit)

- Radically Candid criticism can take different format in different companies.
- Google emphasizes caring personally more than challenging directly. (Twist of Ruinous Empathy)
- Apple does the opposite.  (Twist of Obnoxious Aggression) Says: "do not personalize the criticism. not to say when you are not good enough. Instead it it your work is not good enough."
- **Fundamental attribution error** highlights the role of personal traits rather than external causes. It's easier to find fault in that person than to look for the fault within the context of what that person is doing. It's easier to say "You're sloppy" than to say "You've been working nights and weekends, and it's starting to take a toll on your ability to catch mistakes in your logic."
- Steve Jobs explanations:
> You need to do that in a way that does not call into question your confidence in their abilities but leaves not too much room for interpretation...and that's a hard thing to do

> For criticism to be effective, it's crucial "to do it very clearly and to articulate why... and to get them **back on track**"

- How do you criticize without discouraging the person? 
  - Focus on your relationship
  - Ask for criticism before giving it, and offer more praise than criticism
  - Be humble, helpful, offer guidance in person and immediately, praise in public, criticize in private, and don't personalize.
  - Make it clear that the problem is not due to some unfixable personality flaw.
  - Share stories when you've been criticized for something similar.

#### Think of a simple example ("Your fly is down")
![img_2.png](img_2.png)

- One way to solve a hard problem is to think of a simpler but similar one. Apply same technique to the hard problem.
- 

## 3. Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team (Helping people take a step in the direction of their dreams)

### Rethinking ambition
- Care Personally dimension of Radical Candor.
- Understand how each person's job fits into their life goals.
- Know each person who reports directly to you, to have real, human relationships.
- When putting right people in the right roles on your team, you'll also have to challenge people even more directly than you did with guidance. It will not impact not just their feelings but also their income, their career growth, and their ability to get what they want out of life.

- right positions for right people

- The Apple leader classification
  - Rock stars
  - Super stars
  - You need both
  
- Let go of your judgements
  - What is ambition?
  - What is stable?
  - Think about positive examples

- It is wrong to believe that pushing everybody to grow super-fast was simply "best practice" for building a high-performing team.

![img_3.png](img_3.png)

- "Growth" instead of "potential"
- Determining growth trajectory will help you avoid burning out the rock starts and boring the superstars.
- They will help you build stable teams.

### Growth Management

#### It is getting better all the time
![img_4.png](img_4.png)

- Shifting from traditional "talent management" mind-set to one of "growth management" will help you make sure everyone on your team is moving in the right direction. Creativity flourishes, efficiency improves, people enjoy working together.

- "Growth management" framework to clarify your thinking about how to manage the two different types of high performers. 
  - Those on "steep growth trajectory"
  - Those on "gradual growth trajectory"

- In order to classify, you have to get to know each of your direct reports at a personal level.

- The axes of this framework are past performance and future growth trajectories. The assessment of past performance on the horizontal axis of this framework does go from "bad" to "good", but **not** the vertical axis. It's just as good to be in the bottom-right quadrant as in the upper-right. Rock stars are just as important to a team's performance as superstars. Stability is just as important as growth. The right mix of each will change over time, but you'll always need some of each.

### Understanding what matters and why

- To be successful at growth management, you need to find out what motivates each person on your team.

- "Steep growth" is generally characterized by rapid change - learning new skills or deepening existing ones quickly. It's not about becoming a manager-plenty of individual contributors remain on a steep growth trajectory their entire careers, and plenty of managers are on a gradual growth trajectory.


### The Problem with "Passion"

### Excellent Performance
![img_5.png](img_5.png)

#### Keep your top performers top of mind

#### Be a partner, not an absentee manager or a micromanager

![img_11.png](img_11.png)


### Excellent Performance/Gradual Growth Trajectory

#### Recognize, reward, but don't promote

#### Fair performance ratings

#### Recognition

#### Respect

#### The dangers of promotion obsession

### Excellent Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Keep superstars challenged

#### Keep them challenged (and figure out who'll replace them when they move on)

#### Don't squash them or block them

#### Not every superstar wants to manage

### Managing the middle

#### Raise the bar - There's no such thing as a B-player

### Poor performance/Negative Growth Trajectory

#### Part ways

#### How do you know when it's time to fire somebody?

#### Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing somebody who needs to be fired

1. It will get better.
2. Somebody is better than nobody.
3. A transfer is the answer.
4. It's bad for morale.


#### Be Radically Candid with the person you're firing

1. Recall a job you were terrible at and think how glad you feel that you're no longer in it.
2. Retaining people who are doing bad word penalizes the people doing excellent work.

### Low Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Manager, look at yourself in the mirror!

#### Wrong role

#### New to role; too much too fast

#### Personal problems

#### Poor fit

### No Permanent Markers

#### People change, and you have to change with them

## 4. Drive Results Collaboratively (Telling people what to do does not work.)

### Telling people what to do didn't work at Google

### Telling people what to do didn't work for Steve Jobs Either

### The art of getting stuff done without telling people what to do

### Listen ("Give the quite ones a voice" - Jony Ive)

#### Quiet listening

#### Loud listening

#### Create a culture of listening

#### Adapt to a culture of listening

### Clarify ("It is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things." -Georgia O'Keefe)

### Debate

#### Keep the conversation focused on ideas not egos

#### Create on obligation to dissent

#### Pause for emotion/exhaustion

#### Use humor and have fun

#### Be clear when the debate will end

#### Don't grab a decision just because the debate has gotten painful

### Decide (Push decisions into the facts, or pull facts into the decisions, but keep ego out)

#### You're not the decider (usually)

#### The decider should get facts, not recommendations

### Persuade ("Emotion.Credibility.Logic" -Aristotle)

#### Emotion (The listener's emotions, not the speaker's)

#### Credibility (Demonstrate expertise and humility)

#### Logic (Show your work)

### Execute (Minimize the collaboration tax)

#### Don't waste your team's time

#### Keep the "dirt under your fingernails"

### Stay centered (You can't give a damn about others if you don't give a damn about yourself)

#### Work-life integration

#### Figure out your "recipe" to stay centered and stick to it

#### Calendar

#### Show up for yourself

- Telling other people how to feel will backfire.

- If you really cannot handle emotional outbursts, forgive yourself.

- Keep tissues a short walk away from your desk.

- Keep some closed bottles of water at your desk.

- Walk. don't sit.

## 6. Guidance (Ideas for getting/giving/encouraging praise & criticism)

In order to build a culture of Radically Candid guidance you need to get, give, and encourage both praise and criticism.


![img_12.png](img_12.png)

### Soliciting The Impromptu Guidance (Embrace the discomfort)

- You are the exception to the "criticize in private" rule of thumb
- Have a go-to question
- Embrace the discomfort
- Listen with the intent to understand, not to respond.
- Reward criticism to get more of it.
- Reward criticism to get more of it.
- Gauge the guidance you get.

### Orange Box (Make it not just safe but natural to criticize you)

### Management "Fix-it" weeks

### Giving Impromptu Guidance

#### Be humble

- Situation, behavior, impact.

- Left-hand column.

- "Ontological Humility"

#### Be helpful

- Stating your intention to be helpful can lower defenses.
- Show, don't tell.
- Finding help is better than offering it yourself.
- Guidance is a gift, not a whip or a carrot.

#### Give feedback immediately

- Say it in 2-3 minutes between meetings.
- Keep slack time in your calendar, or be willing to be late.
- Don't "save up" guidance for a 1:1 or performance review.
- Guidance has a short half-life.
- Unspoken criticism explodes like a dirty bomb.
- Avoid black holes.

#### In person (if possible)

- Immediate vs. in person
- Hierarchy of modes.
- Reply All do's and don'ts.
- Being in a remote office is hard.

#### Praise in public, criticize in private

- Corrections, factual observations, disagreements, and debates are different from criticism.
- Adapt to an individual's preferences.
- Group learning

#### Don't personalize

- The "fundamental attribution error" will harm the effectiveness of your guidance.
  - Using perceived personality attributes to explain someone else's behavior rather than considering one's own behavior and/or the situational factors that were probably the real cause of the other person's behavior.


- ![img_8.png](img_8.png)
- ![img_9.png](img_9.png)



- Say "that's wrong" not "you're wrong"
- The phrase "don't take it personally" is worse than useless.
- How not to personalize even when it really is personal.

#### Gauge your impromptu guidance, Get a baseline, Track your improvements

![img_14.png](img_14.png)

#### Being radically candid with your boss

#### Gender and guidance

##### Why Radical Candor may be harder for men managing women
##### Why gender bias makes Radical Gender harder for women
##### What can you do?
##### Men: don't "pull punches" with women
##### Women: demand criticism
##### Men and women: things to think about when you feel a woman is being "too aggressive"
- Switch genders
- Be more specific
- Don't use gendered language
- Never just say, "Be more likeable"

##### Things to think about if you're a woman who's being told, "You're abrasive"
- Never stop challenging directly
- Care personally - but kill the angel in the office.
- The competence/likeability research has not concluded that you weren't out of line.
- Just because it's wrong to kiss up and kick down does not mean it's right to do opposite
- Do not write men off.

##### Formal Performance Reviews
- No surprises
- Do not rely on your unilateral judgement
- Solicit feedback on yourself first
- Write it down
- Make a conscious decision about when to give the written review.
- Schedule at least fifty minutes in person, and do not do reviews back-to-back.
- Spend half the time looking back (diagnosis), half the time looking forward (plan).
- Schedule regular check-ins to assess how the plan is working.
- Deliver the rating/compensation news after the performance review.

### Prevent backstabbing (You are a boss, not a diplomat. Shuttle diplomacy won't work for you)

### Peer guidance
- "Whoops the Monkey"
- Peer gauging

### Speaking Truth to "Power"
- Explain it. Show it Explain it again.
- Ensure the meeting is "not for attribution"
- Take notes and project them
- Kick-start the conversation
- Prioritize issues
- Share notes right after  the meeting
- Ensure that your directs make and communicate changes
- Have these meetings once a year for each of your direct reports.

### Skip level meetings FAQs
- What if it becomes clear that an entire team has lost faith in their manager?
- What if people won't talk?
- What if people won't shut up?
- How do you strike the right balance between being supportive of the boss you're hearing about and being open to the team's thoughts?

## 7. Team (Techniques for avoiding boredom and burnout)

### Career Conversations (Understand people's motivations and ambitions to help them take a step in the direction of their dreams)

- Conversation one: life story
- The second conversations: dreams
- Conversation three: eighteen-month plan

### Growth Management (Figure out who needs what types of opportunities, and how you're going to provide them)

- Put names in boxes (temporarily!)
- Write growth plans
- Don't be an "easy grader" or a "hard a grader"
- Ensure fairness by level

### Hiring: Your Mentality and Your Process

#### Process
- Job description: define team "fit" as rigorously as you define "skills" to minimize bias.
- Blind skills assessments can also minimize bias.
- Use the same interview committee for multiple candidates, to allow for meaningful comparisons.
- Make interviews productive by jotting down your thoughts right away.
- In-person debrief/decision: if you're not dying to hire the person, don't make an offer.

### Firing (A necessary evil)

#### Do not wait too long
#### Do not make the decision unilaterally
#### Give a damn
#### Follow up

### Promotions (Be fair)
- Prepare
- Manage the time carefully, and don't let arguments go on too long.
- Get enough sleep the day before, exercise that morning, and eat a good breakfast.
- When it's all done, acknowledge how hard these conversations are.

### Reward Your Rock Stars (Don't give all the glory to the superstars)

#### Avoid promotion/status obsession
#### Say "thank-you"
#### Gurus
#### Public presentations

### Summary

### Avoid absentee management and micromanagement

## 8. Results (Things you can do to get stuff done together-faster)

1. 1:1 Conversations
2. Staff Meetings
3. Think Time
4. "Big Debate" Meetings
5. "Big Decision" Meetings
6. All-Hands Meetings
7. Meeting-Free Zones
8. Kanban Boards
9. Walk Around
10. Be Conscious of Culture

### 1:1 Conversations (Employees set the agenda, you listen and help them clarify)

#### Mind-set
#### Frequency
#### Show up!
#### Your direct report's agenda, not yours
#### Some good follow-up questions
- "Why"
- "How can I help"
- "What can I do or stop doing that would make this easier?"
- "What wakes you up at night"?
- "What are you working on that you don't want to work on?"
  - "Do you not want to work on it because you are not interested or because you think it's not important?"
  - "What can you do to stop working on it?"
- "How do you feel about priorities of the teams you're dependent on?"
  - "What are they working on that seems unimportant or even counterproductive?"
  - "What are they not doing that you wish they would do?"
  - "Have you talked to these other teams direct about your concerns? If not, why?" (Important note: the goal here is to encourage the people to raise the issue directly with each other, not to solve the problem for them. See "Prevent Backstabbing" in chapter six.)

#### Encourage new ideas in the 1:1.
- "What do you need to develop that idea further so that it's ready to discuss with the broader team? How can I help?"
- "I think you're on to something, but it's still not clear to me. Can you try explaining it again?"
- "Let's wrestle some more with it, OK?"
- "I understand what you mean, but I don't think others will. How can you explain it so it will be easier for them to understand?"
- "I don't think 'so-and-so" will understand this. Can you explain it again to make it clearer specifically for them?"
- "Is the problem really that they are too stupid to understand, or is it that you are not explaining it clearly enough?"

#### Signs you'll get from 1:1s that you're failing as a boss

- Cancellations
- Updates
- Good news only
- No criticism
- No agenda

### Staff Meetings (Review metrics, study hall updates, and identify (but do not make) key decisions)

#### Learn: review key metrics (twenty minutes)
#### Listen: put updates in a shared document (fifteen minutes)
#### Clarify: identify key decisions & debates (thirty minutes)

### Think Time (Block time to think, and hold that time sacred)

### "Big Debate" Meetings (Lower the tension by making it clear that you are debating, not deciding)

#### They lower tension

#### They allow you to slow down key decisions when appropriate

#### They foster a larger culture of debate

### "Big Decisions" Meetings (Push decisions into the facts, pull facts into the dceisions, and keep egos at bay)

### All-Hands Meetings (Bring others along)

### Execution time (Fight meeting proliferation)

### Kanban Boards (Make activity and workflows visible)

### Walk Around (Learn about small problems to prevent big ones)

### Be Conscious of Culture (Everyone is watching you, but that doesn't mean it's all about you)

#### People are listening. Like it or not, you're under the microscope

#### Clarify. Be vigilant about clarifying what you are communicating

#### Debate and decide explicitly. Don't let things that pervert your culture "just happen"

#### Persuade. Pay attention to the small things

#### Execute: Action should reflect your culture

#### Learn

#### Listen. . .

## Afterword to the revised edition (Rolling Out Radical Candor)


### You

#### Improve using role plays and storytelling

#### Practise: What's your story?

#### Practice: The Feedback Triangle

#### Solicit Criticism First

1. solicit criticism
2. give praise
3. give criticism
4. gauge the criticism and adjust
5. encourage praise and criticism between others

##### Kim's Soliciting Feedback Story

### A go-to question you can actually image asking

- **Sincere**. People have well-tuned BS detectors. If you sound like you're parroting something you read in a book, even a great book, you're not going to sound sincere
- **Don't ask questions that can be answered with a yes or no.**  
  - "What could I do or stop doing"
- **Specific vs open-ended** 
  - "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" 
  - "I worry that sometimes I interrupt people before they've had a chance to express themselves adequately. When have you seen me do that? Will you flag it for me if you see me do it next week?"
- **Frequency** Asking frequently for feedback helps to increase the likelihood that feedback is actionable.

#### Some questions:

- In the last week, when would you have preferred that I be more or less involved in your work?
- Tell me why I'm off base here.
- What's something I could have done differently this week to make your job easier?
- How could I best support your professional development right now?
- What's something I've done in the last week that made it difficult to work with me?
- What's a blind spot of mine that you have noticed?
- The most important thing you can do for both of us is to tell me when I've screwed up.
- I feel like I didn't do as well as I could have in that meeting, but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Can you help me figure out?
- I'm really trying to do X better. I know in theory it's a problem but I'm not always aware in the moment. Can you help me by pointing it out when you see it?

1. Did it produce useful feedback?
2. Did it sound natural, i.e, like something you'd actually say?

### Embrace the discomfort 


So much of putting Radical Candor into practice is being able to move through social awkwardness.
Ask your question to a friendly colleague **then count to six**. Do not allow yourself to say anything no matter how awkward you feel or they look. Of course, some will remain silent. If they do, tell them you'll give them more time but that you will comme back to them because you really want their feedback. **(Enforcing feedback)**



### Listen with the intent to understand, not to reply
- Your job is not to give advice, it's to listen.

### Make Listening Tangible: Reward The Candor

When someone offers you criticism, they are taking a risk. It is your job to make sure they are rewarded for taking that risk.

**Practice: Make Listening Tangible**
At a team meeting, share some feedback you received in the past week, what you learned from it, your gratitude for it, and what you plan to do about it.

**Practice: Reward criticism you disagree with**

### Build it into your existing scheduled

**Practice: add soliciting feedback to the end of your 1:1 agenda**
