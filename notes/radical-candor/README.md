# Part I - A New Management Philosophy

## 1. Build Radically Candid Relationships (Bringing your self to work)
### It's called management, and it's your job

- Emotional labor is the key to being a good boss.

### How to be a good boss

- Bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their theams
- Bosses guide a team to achieve results.
- **Guidance**, **team**, **results**: these are the responsibilities of any boss.
  - Guidance: feedback
  - Team-building: hiring,firing,promoting
  - Results: Get things done

### Relationships, not power, drive you forward

### Radical Candor

### Care Personally:The First Dimension of Radical Candor

### Challenge Directly: The Second Dimension of Radical Candor

### What Radical Candor is Not

### Radical Candor is Universally Human, but interpersonally and culturally relative


## 2. Get, Dive, and Encourage Guidance (Create a culture of open communication)

### The "UM" story

### "Operationalizing" Good Guidance

### Radical Candor

#### Radically Candid praise "I admire that about you"

#### Radically Candid criticism "To keep winning, criticize the wins"

### Obnoxious Aggression

#### Obnoxiously aggressive criticism (Front-stabbing)

#### Obnoxiously aggressive praise (Belittling compliments)

### Manipulative Insincerity


#### Manipulatively insincere praise


### Ruinous Empathy

#### Ruinously empathetic praise "Just trying to say something nice"

### Moving Toward Radical Candor

#### Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it (Do not dish it out before you show you can take it)

#### Balance praise and criticism (Worry more about praise, less about criticism - but above all be sincere)

#### Understand the perilous border between Obnoxious Aggression and Radical Candor (Your work is shit)

#### Think of a simple example ("Your fly is down")


## 3. Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team (Helping people take a step in the direction of their dreams)

### Rethinking ambition

### Growth Management

#### It is getting better all the time

### Understanding what matters and why

### The Problem with "Passion"

### Excellent Performance

#### Keep your top performers top of mind

#### Be a partner, not an absentee manager or a micromanager

### Excellent Performance/Gradual Growth Trajectory

#### Recognize, reward, but don't promote

#### Fair performance ratings

#### Recognition

#### Respect

#### The dangers of promotion obsession

### Excellent Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Keep superstars challenged

#### Keep them challenged (and figure out who'll replace them when they move on)

#### Don't squash them or block them

#### Not every superstar wants to manage

### Managing the middle

#### Raise the bar - There's no such thing as a B-player

### Poor performance/Negative Growth Trajectory

#### Part ways

#### How do you know when it's time to fire somebody?

#### Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing somebody who needs to be fired

1. It will get better.
2. Somebody is better than nobody.
3. A transfer is the answer.
4. It's bad for morale.


#### Be Radically Candid with the person you're firing

1. Recall a job you were terrible at and think how glad you feel that you're no longer in it.
2. Retaining people who are doing bad word penalizes the people doing excellent work.

### Low Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Manager, look at yourself in the mirror!

#### Wrong role

#### New to role; too much too fast

#### Personal problems

#### Poor fit

### No Permanent Markers

#### People change, and you have to change with them

## 4. Drive Results Collaboratively (Telling people what to do does not work.)
