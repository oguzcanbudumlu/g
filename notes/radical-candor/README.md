# Part I - A New Management Philosophy

## 1. Build Radically Candid Relationships (Bringing your self to work)
### It's called management, and it's your job

- Emotional labor is the key to being a good boss.

### How to be a good boss

- Bosses are responsible for results. They achieve these results not by doing all the work themselves but by guiding the people on their theams
- Bosses guide a team to achieve results.
- **Guidance**, **team**, **results**: these are the responsibilities of any boss.
  - Guidance: feedback
  - Team-building: hiring,firing,promoting
  - Results: Get things done

### Relationships, not power, drive you forward

### Radical Candor

### Care Personally:The First Dimension of Radical Candor

### Challenge Directly: The Second Dimension of Radical Candor

### What Radical Candor is Not

### Radical Candor is Universally Human, but interpersonally and culturally relative


## 2. Get, Dive, and Encourage Guidance (Create a culture of open communication)

### The "UM" story

### "Operationalizing" Good Guidance

### Radical Candor

#### Radically Candid praise "I admire that about you"

#### Radically Candid criticism "To keep winning, criticize the wins"

### Obnoxious Aggression

#### Obnoxiously aggressive criticism (Front-stabbing)

#### Obnoxiously aggressive praise (Belittling compliments)

### Manipulative Insincerity


#### Manipulatively insincere praise


### Ruinous Empathy

#### Ruinously empathetic praise "Just trying to say something nice"

### Moving Toward Radical Candor

#### Start by asking for criticism, not by giving it (Do not dish it out before you show you can take it)

#### Balance praise and criticism (Worry more about praise, less about criticism - but above all be sincere)

#### Understand the perilous border between Obnoxious Aggression and Radical Candor (Your work is shit)

#### Think of a simple example ("Your fly is down")


## 3. Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team (Helping people take a step in the direction of their dreams)

### Rethinking ambition

### Growth Management

#### It is getting better all the time

### Understanding what matters and why

### The Problem with "Passion"

### Excellent Performance

#### Keep your top performers top of mind

#### Be a partner, not an absentee manager or a micromanager

### Excellent Performance/Gradual Growth Trajectory

#### Recognize, reward, but don't promote

#### Fair performance ratings

#### Recognition

#### Respect

#### The dangers of promotion obsession

### Excellent Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Keep superstars challenged

#### Keep them challenged (and figure out who'll replace them when they move on)

#### Don't squash them or block them

#### Not every superstar wants to manage

### Managing the middle

#### Raise the bar - There's no such thing as a B-player

### Poor performance/Negative Growth Trajectory

#### Part ways

#### How do you know when it's time to fire somebody?

#### Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing somebody who needs to be fired

1. It will get better.
2. Somebody is better than nobody.
3. A transfer is the answer.
4. It's bad for morale.


#### Be Radically Candid with the person you're firing

1. Recall a job you were terrible at and think how glad you feel that you're no longer in it.
2. Retaining people who are doing bad word penalizes the people doing excellent work.

### Low Performance/Steep Growth Trajectory

#### Manager, look at yourself in the mirror!

#### Wrong role

#### New to role; too much too fast

#### Personal problems

#### Poor fit

### No Permanent Markers

#### People change, and you have to change with them

## 4. Drive Results Collaboratively (Telling people what to do does not work.)

### Telling people what to do didn't work at Google

### Telling people what to do didn't work for Steve Jobs Either

### The art of getting stuff done without telling people what to do


### Listen ("Give the quite ones a voice" - Jony Ive)

#### Quiet listening

#### Loud listening

#### Create a culture of listening

#### Adapt to a culture of listening

### Clarify ("It is only by selection, by elimination, and by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things." -Georgia O'Keefe)

#### Be clear in your own mind (Create a safe space to nurture new ideas)

#### Be clear to others (Make thoughts/ideas drop-dead easy for others to comprehend)

### Debate

#### Keep the conversation focused on ideas not egos

#### Create on obligation to dissent

#### Pause for emotion/exhaustion

#### Use humor and have fun

#### Be clear when the debate will end

#### Don't grab a decision just because the debate has gotten painful

### Decide (Push decisions into the facts, or pull facts into the decisions, but keep ego out)

#### You're not the decider (usually)

#### The decider should get facts, not recommendations

### Persuade ("Emotion.Credibility.Logic" -Aristotle)

#### Emotion (The listener's emotions, not the speaker's)

#### Credibility (Demonstrate expertise and humility)

#### Logic (Show your work)

### Execute (Minimize the collaboration tax)

#### Don't waste your team's time

#### Keep the "dirt under your fingernails"

#### Block time to execute

### Learn ("Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds" - Ralph Waldo Emerson)

#### Pressure to be consistent

#### Burnout

# Part 2 - Tools & Techniques

## 5. Relationships (An approach to establishing trust with your direct reports)

### Stay centered (You can't give a damn about others if you don't give a damn about yourself)

#### Work-life integration

#### Figure out your "recipe" to stay centered and stick to it

#### Calendar

#### Show up for yourself

### Free at work

### Master the art of socializing at work

#### Even non-mandatory events can feel mandatory

#### Booze

### Respect Boundaries

#### Building Trust

#### Sharing Values

#### Demonstrating openness

#### Physical space

#### Recognizing your own emotions

#### Master your reactions to others' emotions

- Ask questions.

- Adding your guilt to other people's difficult emotions does not make them feel better.

- Telling other people how to feel will backfire.

- If you really cannot handle emotional outbursts, forgive yourself.

- Keep tissues a short walk away from your desk.

- Keep some closed bottles of water at your desk.

- Walk. don't sit.
